# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
The overview of this project was to help Louise look at how the campaigns faired with their goals set. I was able to see there were a lot of campaigns that manage to be successfull in reaching their goals. Adversely, there are still quite a few campaigns who managed to failed and majority of them failed by a very small amount. Looking briefly at the chart there were many categories for campaigns All except Journalism produced some successful campaigns. ![Parent Category Outcomes Table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92553694/138611133-1de13424-d52a-4b1a-8ed5-70483975c04c.png)
Since Lousie was more so closely related with Theater we took a closer look at that category and its findings. Giving us a much closer look at this broad data set. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to look at the different campaigns and to see if which ones were successfully able to reach their goal before their launch dates and which ones failed. Charts were used to add a visual aid to make some of the data a bit easier to read. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We are able to see that theater was a huge parent category with a lot of data to deal with. There were more succesfull than failed and canceled campaigns here. There were actualy and extremely low amount of canceled campaigns with none coming in the month of October. The months of may an djune saw the most successful and failed campaigns, seems these two months were popular with launch dates.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We are able to take a closer look at the percentage of successful, failed and canceled plays based on their respective goals. One thing we notice is that there were no canceled plays. Also we can see that there was a high amount of successful plays within goals less than $9999.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Combing through the data was not easy. Especially when there are a lot of information that could have been left out. One challenge I found was converting the launch and deadline dates. I kept forgetting to put a close parentheses and I would get error. Also that conversion is a bit tricky to remember. Another challenge that I came about was finding the number of successful, failed and canceled campaigns. It took some time for me to understand where to put the "<=" of the goals. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
One of the conclusions we can draw from the Outcomes based on Launch Data is there was a spike in sucssesfful campaigns during the months of may and june. Also the amount of canceled theater Campaigns were extremely low.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
What we can conclude about this is a lot of the campaigns decided to go with smaller goals which those seemed to have a higher success rate. Also there were no canceled campaigns. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
one limitation is that the US has a majority of the kickstartes leaving the rest of the countries with just ~1,000 kick starters. Another limitation is having excess information such as the blurbs or the currency, sometimes eliminating the extra information could allow us to focus more on the data given. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? We could have created a bar graph to look at the average donations/backers count from different countries to get a better look at how much/how many was donated via each country.
